# KRP Semestral Project

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with USB 2.0 device-side implementation while combining it with a humanâ€“machine interface (HMI) on the STM32H747I-DISCO board.
The STM board will act as a virtual sensor device, sending live data to a PC over the implemented USB and receiving commands back from the PC.
